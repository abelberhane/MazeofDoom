# MazeofDoom

The Maze of Doom is a Simple C# game created in Visual Studio. I wanted something that I could practice switching between forms based off
an event action, being able to Play audio/sound clips and general practice. It took about an hour and the most interesting aspect of this 
project would have to be the utilization of the Picture Box and how I was able to enable it to monitor the Mouse movements.
