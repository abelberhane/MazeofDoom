The game ends when you are able to Succesfully follow the path to the end. But beware, rumor has it an evil witch awaits for all who cross her forrest. Good Luck!

I wanted something that I could practice switching between forms based off
an event action, being able to Play audio/sound clips and general practice. It took about an hour and the most interesting aspect of this 
project would have to be the utilization of the Picture Box and how I was able to enable it to monitor the Mouse movements.
